# Basyl Journal

This is a simple application used to collect journal entries, and keep them organized, encrypted, and personal. 

This application is useful for many people, even people who aren't concerned with cyber-security.

All you have to do is type in a journal password, and it will create a new (or open an existing) journal for you to log entries in. Most people don't have a dedicated notes app, and Notepad scatters files everywhere. This application keeps things organized.

### How it works

This information is for the tech people. When you type in your password, it generates a special hash that is used for your file name. This password is also used for encryption.

This is how it keeps your journals accessible yet private, and keeps people from mining any information about your journal.

It uses BES for Encryption.

### Todo
